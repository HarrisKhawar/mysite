      <p>I love South Park so I made this wallpaper to hang up in my bedroom. The South Park characters are from the video game <em>'The Fractured But Whole'</em>. On the left there is an animated picture of J. Cole sitting next to a grave. I
        discovered J. Cole around the time when the leader singer of Linkin Park, Chester Bennington died.</p>

      <p>A friend of mine came to me with an idea for a start up. I was extremely busy with school, but I wanted to be a part of it somehow. So I designed a logo and an application icon for it. The start up never actually started up.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="public/photoshop/posterHoli.jpg" alt="posterHoli">
          <p>The South Asian Students Association of my college was hosting an event for Holi together with another college so I made this poster. It was never used though.</p>

          <p>My father was a member of the Toastmaster Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka and he was supposed to host an event. I made this poster for the publicity of the event.</p>

      <img class="img-fluid" src="public/photoshop/pakturkBonfire.jpg" alt="pakturkBonfire">
      <p>This is from back in the days when I started using Photoshop. There was a bonfire at my school and I was the only affordable designer. The poster didn't turn out to be great when it was printed. But the bornfire went quite well.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="public/photoshop/posterSummerFest.jpg" alt="posterSummerFest">
          <p>This is also one of my earliest photoshop designs. I made this poster for an event at my school. Having made a different poster for the same event for last two years, I asked the organisers to pay me this time. They did! But then every following year they just changed the date on this one.</p>

          <img class="img-fluid" src="public/photoshop/posterIvyPrep.jpg" alt="posterIvyPrep">
          <p>My high school counselor started a private education consultancy company. He helped me a lot during my university applications process' so I tried to help him by making advertisement posters of all the students he helped get admissions. This is one of them.</p>
